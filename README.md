Hi there 👋🤗

My name is João Pedro, and the following are a few things about me:

📚👨🏼‍💻I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems Analysis and Development at the Federal Institute of São Paulo – Bragança Paulista campus.
🧠🏛️Beyond my interest in technology, I have a strong enthusiasm for medicine, psychology, and history.
🎮🥊I am passionate about video games and have recently started learning boxing.
🚀🌟What matters most to me in life is making it possible for everyone to explore their desires and realize their full potential.
🐶❤️And last but not least, I have a deep love for dogs—especially my Border Collie named Zuko.
